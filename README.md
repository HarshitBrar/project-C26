This is my favourite desert, namely Red Velvet Cake with cream cheese frosting! 
Red velvet cake is much more then vanilla cake tinted red.This recipe produces best red velvet cake with superior buttery, vanilla, and cocoa flavors, as well as a delicious tang from buttermilk.My trick is to whip the egg whites, which guarantees a smooth velvet crumb.This is my forever favorite red velvet cake recipe.
